**Coding Project (React with TypeScript): Infinite Scrolling and Searchable Product List**

You have been assigned a task to implement an infinite scrolling list of products in a **React project written in TypeScript**. The product data will be fetched from an API. Additionally, you need to provide a search functionality that allows users to search for products by name.

***Requirements***

**Using this [product api](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products) to implement the infinite scrolling list for display list of products.**

1. Each time the user **scrolls to the end of the list, fetch the next 20 products**.
2. **Display the list of products** with relevant information (e.g., name, price, image).
    1. Keep the design as simple as possible. Please note that the **design will not be evaluated.**
3. Implement an **input for searching product name** (using */products/search?q* ). 
Whenever user typing, fetch data and update the product list.
4. Products data should be deserialized after fetched from api. 

**Your Task:**

- Your task is to complete the implementation of the **React** component(s) necessary to achieve the above requirements.
- You are **free to use any additional libraries or tools as needed.**

Please **structure your code in a clean and maintainable manner**. It should demonstrate your understanding of **React**, TypeScript, API integration, and handling state updates efficiently.
